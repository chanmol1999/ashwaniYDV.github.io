<h1>Hi, I’m Ashwani, the guy behind and front of this site!</h1>
<p>I’m a 2nd year undergrad at IIT Patna, who believe in technology and playing around with stuffs. I hail from Kanpur(U.P.), India. After years of slogging and hardwork, I finally managed to gain admission to the Indian Institute of Technology, Patna as an Undergratuate in Electrical <del>Computer Science</del> Engineering.</p>
<p>I am passionate about computer science, building things and celebrating the joy of programming. I tend to waste my time reading books, watching movies, TV-series, playing games, hanging out with friends, sleeping and prcrstintng (…).</p>
<p>Apart from programming my other hobbies also include playing football and guitar. I am a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy genre novels.</p>

<h1>Why did you decide to create a site?</h1>
<p>I create the site based on the principle of: <strong>to share my knowledge</strong> and <strong>to share my hobbies.</strong></p>
<p>I felt that I needed to expose all of my raw accumulative knowledge in something or somewhere. Making some search on the internet I discover that, to retain <strong>75%</strong> learners need to put into practice what they learned and incredible <strong>90%</strong> learners approximately retain when they teach someone else/use immediately.</p>
<p>In general, to left my footprint on this virtual world, and to bore you all.</p>

<h1>How can I contact you?</h1>
<p>Why you want to contact me, I am no use to you!! Still you want to chat, give and receive advice/tips and so forth?</p>

<h1>What inspires me.</h1>
<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck" style="color: #0000EE;" target="_blank">Believe you can change</a>
<p>Fixies try to blame the world when things go bad, growthers look to see what they can change about themselves. Fixies are afraid to try hard — because if they fail, it means they’re a failure. Growthers are afraid of not trying.</p>

<h1>One more thing</h1>
You noticed that I’m not an <strong>“English native”</strong> not even an <strong>“Expert”</strong>, but I’m writing in English because I want to get better and reach to the fluency. I’ll appreciate if you help me spend your precious time send me your suggestion and correction about my sentences. ;)
