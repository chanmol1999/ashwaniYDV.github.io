<p>Google Summer of Code is probably the most prestigious internship that a college undergrad can get into these days. Millions of students over the world apply and only a thousand are selected. I too wanted to give it a shot.</p>

<p>I got selected for GSoC 2020 to work for Rocket.Chat which is a chat application and enables you to have your own personal chat application.</p>

<p>My project is focused to implement a new interface between Rocket.Chat and the Omnichannel Livechat widget, allowing Agents to get real-time screen-share on customerâ€™s devices. So, I have to implement a kind of generic bridge and then add screen sharing providers such as cobrowse.io. Cobrowse.io will be the first provider supported through the generic bridge.</p>
